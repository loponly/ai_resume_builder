## Quality Review

**Resume:**

* **Strengths:** The resume is well-organized, clearly highlighting relevant skills and experience. Quantifiable achievements are effectively showcased using numbers and metrics.  The skills section is tailored to the job description.  The addition of project links significantly strengthens the resume.
* **Areas for Improvement:**  The summary could be slightly more concise and impactful, focusing on the most relevant achievements.  While the skills section is good, explicitly mentioning familiarity with FastAPI (if true) would be beneficial, as would explicitly listing any ML frameworks you've worked with (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).  Consider using action verbs at the start of each bullet point in the experience section to make it more dynamic.


**Cover Letter:**

* **Strengths:** The cover letter effectively demonstrates enthusiasm for the role and company.  It highlights relevant skills and experience using specific examples from the resume.  The inclusion of the GitHub profile link is excellent.
* **Areas for Improvement:**  While the letter is good, it could be strengthened by more directly addressing the "democratizing AI" mission of TechFlow AI.  Connect your past experiences to how they specifically contribute to that mission.  Instead of simply stating familiarity with ML concepts, briefly describe a specific experience or project demonstrating this understanding.


**Overall:**

Both the resume and cover letter are well-crafted and significantly improved from the original.  By addressing the suggested improvements, you'll create an even stronger application that clearly demonstrates your qualifications and suitability for the Senior Full Stack Developer role at TechFlow AI.  Remember to proofread carefully before submitting.
